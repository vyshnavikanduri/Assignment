Probhlem: Series of Ap
Algorithm:
`nthTermOfAP` function appears to be designed to find the nth term of an arithmetic progression (AP). The function calculates the nth term using the formula for the nth term of an AP:

a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) * d

Where:
-  a_n  is the nth term,
-  a_1 is the first term,
-  n is the term number, and
-  d is the common difference between consecutive terms.

Code:
class Solution {
    public static int nthTermOfAP(int a1, int a2, int n) {
        // code here
        int d=a2-a1;
        int an=a1+(n-1)*d;
        return an;
    }
}
