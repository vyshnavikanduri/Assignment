//To find the number on the opposite face of the given face of the dice you can use the property that the sum of opposite faces on a standard six-faced dice is always 7
//So to find the opposite face of the given face N you can subtract N from 7
class Solution{
    static int oppositeFaceOfDice(int N){
        // code here
        return 7 - N;
