//Swap the values of a and b:
//To swap the values of a and b without using a temporary variable, we can perform arithmetic operations.
//a = a + b: After this operation, a contains the sum of the original values of a and b.
//b = a - b: Now, b is assigned the value of a, which effectively swaps the original value of a to b.
//a = a - b: Finally, a is assigned the original value of b, effectively swapping the original value of b to a.
//Return the swapped values as a list:
//The function returns a list containing the swapped values a and b.
